Some thoughts about Token Issuance on Ethereum

How token is issued affects behaviour of th
There's many different ways to issue a token. 
Token can be issud to the public - anyone can get some by sending eth tx to the contract,
or private, allocated to specific addresses. 

Public, in exchange for ether:

1. Time and amount of tokens issued.

a. Issuance happens once over a fixed period of time. There is no more issued in the future
b. More tokens issued at some time in the future, unclear how much
c. More tokens issued in the future, but the amount is fixed
c. In response to other behaviour than ether tx


2. Some crowdsale behaviour:

a. Amount of tokens exchanged for eth lessens every N of days
b. Dutch auction
c. Price of tokens stays the same

3. And the ways to limit the amount of tokens ever issued

a. Stops after N days of the crowdsale
b. Stops when the ether cap is reached

We can imagine a scenario in which one doesn't want to raise a lot of funds immediately, in that case
it would be practical to issue tokens in chunks - run a number of small crowdsales.
The good thing about it is that you don't have to manage a lot of ether straight away, and have time to
develop trust by reaching milestones or building an MVP.
Bad side is that it takes resources to actually manage a crowdsale, since there are more and more of them.

There can be also a DAO-like management process, where a decision on whether the new crowdsale happens
is made by existing tokenholder's votes. Votes however are another rabbit hole.
