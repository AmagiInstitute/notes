*Light Client for Digital CryptoArtifacts*

We need to be able to manage our portfolios of digital cryptocolectibles on mobile. A topic of digital collectibles as cryptoassets has been explored by a number of projects, but Cryptokitties will open a new era
of cryptocolectibles. I prefer to call them cryptoartifacts. 

Ideally such client should be able to support existing cryptocollectibles, as well as allow everyone to issue the new ones, by their own rules. To use their own procedural generation algos or custom issuance rules.

Cryto assets management software was always slow to on UX side,
and even slower on mobile. Now we have a number of pretty good mobile light clients for btc and ltc.

There has been some progress in development of Ethereum light clients. I'm interested in Ethereum based
cryptoartifacts portfolio management system, but mobile clients supporting other chains would be very useful.
Such application can be, for starters, an extended version of Walleth https://github.com/walleth/walleth 
that can support various artifacts, and features that allows to issue new artifacts and new artifact collections.


Collectibles were a part of human culture way before money as we know it, and it's not going away. 

**Little bit of history**

Digital Collectible Card Games been around for over 20 years https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_collectible_card_game
Decentralised systems and protocols such as Ethereum or Bitcoin 
History of crytpocurrency is related to digital collectibles in many ways.
For instance, Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange, MtGox.com url later became the ill-famed bitcoin exchange.

A topic of digital collectibles as cryptoassets has been explored by a number of projects.
Some were launched as a Counterparty assets https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=957797.0


**Notable Projects**

Here are notable projects for digital cryptocollectible assets: 
Rare Pepe http://rarepepedirectory.com/ 
and most recent Cryptokitties https://www.cryptokitties.co
Both wotk in a browser, not on mobile. Both appeal to more general public than collectible card games.

**Procedural Generation**

What procedural generation has to do with it?
Many games are using procedural generation to create patterns and textures and generate in game worlds. 
Species in No Man's Sky are procedurally generated https://nomanssky.gamepedia.com/Species
CryptoCollectibles (or CryptoArtifacts) can be either procedurally generated, handmade or hybrid. 

**Some examples of cryptocollectibles / cryptoartifacts**

Collectibles can come in many shapes and forms with different parameters of issuance, some can have AR components.
They can be valued for rarity, or for example, be issued in limited amounts at notable events. 

- Shells
CryptoArtifacts for Project Entropy http://project-entropy.com/
Represent procedurally generated images that look roughly like sea shells. 

- Crypto Crispr
Represent procedurally generated species similar to ones from No Man Sky. Perhaps can breed like cryptokitties. 
Generation can be affected by a number of factors from a combination of species to surrounding area, environment, or location.

Cryptoartifacts don't hvae to be useful, and in my opinion are better off not to have any other use tha

"The precursors of money, along with language, enabled early modern humans to solve problems of cooperation 
that other animals cannot – including problems of reciprocal altruism, kin altruism, and the mitigation of aggression. 
These precursors shared with non-fiat currencies very specific characteristics – 
they were not merely symbolic or decorative objects." Szabo 2002
