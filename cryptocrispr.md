***Some notes on Cryptoartifacts***

Notable projects for digital cryptocollectible assets: 
Rare Pepe http://rarepepedirectory.com/ 
and most recent Cryptokitties https://www.cryptokitties.co
Both appeal to more general public than collectible card games.

Collectibles were a part of human culture way before money and currency as we know it, and it's not going away. 
It's, perhaps, not even a good move on my behalf to mention the word money, since the term itslef is confusing.
Let's ditch for a moment a Wikipedia definition of money. I find it easier and clearer to refer to money and currency as a form of language that people use to express different concepts largely related to value. Money and currencies as we have it now is a rather primitive language, yet, good enough to communicate certain things. For example we don't have to all agree which theory of value creation we find the best to speak money and currency languages. Money discussion is a whole different
rabbit hole, and let's get back to the kitties. 

Many people found cryptokitties phenomena absurd, but they're slightly missing the point. It's okay, if you
think that the whole complex concept of value can be reduce it to "can I eat it" or "can I sell it" that's fine.

A few good reads by Nick Szabo would be a good start of the conversation http://unenumerated.blogspot.co.uk/2016/07/artifacts-of-wealth-patterns-in_15.html 


**What are technical and UX requirements for cryptoartifacts**

- We need to be able to manage our portfolios of digital cryptocolectibles on mobile. A topic of digital collectibles as cryptoassets has been explored by a number of projects, but Cryptokitties might open a new era
of cryptocolectibles. I prefer to call them cryptoartifacts. While Rare Pepes are already available on Android, 
as far as I know non of the Ethereum mobile implementations handle collectibles. 

- Ideally, such client should be able to support existing cryptocollectibles, as well as allow everyone to issue the new ones, by their own rules. To use their own procedural generation algos or custom issuance rules. 

- Unlike with Cryptokitties, the artifacts should use decentralised storage such as IPFS or Swarm. This will provide
better safety of the cryptoartifacts, scalability and accessibility. 

- Indexing and search can be done by centralised services. Perhaps in some federated manner. 

Cryto assets management software was always a bit slow to on UX side,
and even slower on mobile. Now we have a number of pretty good mobile light clients for btc and ltc.

There has been some progress in development of Ethereum light clients. I'm interested in Ethereum based
cryptoartifacts portfolio management system, but mobile clients supporting other chains would be very useful.
Such application can be, for starters, an extended version of Walleth https://github.com/walleth/walleth 
that can support various artifacts, and features that allows to issue new artifacts and new artifact collections.

Before Ethereum ecosystem will be efficiently handling tx load, DPOS systems might be more suitable. 


**Little bit of history**

Digital Collectible Card Games been around for over 20 years https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_collectible_card_game
Decentralised systems and protocols such as Ethereum or Bitcoin 
History of crytpocurrency is related to digital collectibles in many ways.
For instance, Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange, MtGox.com url later became the ill-famed bitcoin exchange.

A topic of digital collectibles as cryptoassets has been explored by a number of projects.
Some were launched as a Counterparty assets https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=957797.0


**Procedural Generation**

What procedural generation has to do with it?
Many games are using procedural generation to create patterns and textures and generate in game worlds. 
Species in No Man's Sky are procedurally generated https://nomanssky.gamepedia.com/Species
CryptoCollectibles (or CryptoArtifacts) can be either procedurally generated, handmade or hybrid. 

**Some examples of cryptocollectibles / cryptoartifacts**

Collectibles can come in many shapes and forms with different parameters of issuance, some can have AR components.
They can be valued for dankness , rarity, or for example, be issued in limited amounts at notable events. 

- Shells
CryptoArtifacts for Project Entropy http://project-entropy.com/
Represent procedurally generated images that look roughly like sea shells. 

- Crypto Crispr
Represent procedurally generated species similar to ones from No Man Sky. Perhaps can breed like cryptokitties. 
Generation can be affected by a number of factors from a combination of species to surrounding area, environment, or location.

- Autographs from artists you value.
Even though digital music can be copied (that's why copyright has been poorly compatible with digital world) having an album or a dj set signed by the artist is a collectors item. In some cases an artist can choose to sign a digital flyer or an album cover only at the party or a concert itself in a physical location. 
A graphi artist can issue a limited amount of posters, and even though anyone can copy them online, the copies won't have 
s signature. In the examples like Rare Pepe or Cryptokitties the market proves that a screenshot of a rare Pepe wouldn't have
the samevalue as the colectible item. Same applies to the digital graphic representation of a kitty. 

Cryptoartifacts don't hvae to be useful, and in my opinion are better off not to have any other use than a symbolic meaning.

"The precursors of money, along with language, enabled early modern humans to solve problems of cooperation 
that other animals cannot – including problems of reciprocal altruism, kin altruism, and the mitigation of aggression. 
These precursors shared with non-fiat currencies very specific characteristics – 
they were not merely symbolic or decorative objects." Szabo 2002
