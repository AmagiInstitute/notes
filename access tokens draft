Some patterns about collective ownership of stuff and access to it. This is a draft and free writing.


Lets take a few experiments of what largely can be described as managing commons by using tokens.
Tokens are easy to make, and are commonly used for raising funds and a specialised currency. 

- Entropy Boat
- Ponzi.Bar
- Biocommons

In all three cases we are talking about access to some stuff by many people. 
In this context it is also useful, to think of ownership as a bundle of rights, otherwise it becomes a bullshit concept.


Entropy Boat
Is a fleet of boats, starting with just one boat, which is owned and managed by a bunch of poeple,
but in a slighly more sophisticated way than timesharing.
Poeple aquire Entropy boat token for ether, ether is spent on buying and reparing boats,
and converting them into hackspaces
people can do stuff with those boats, come to hack spaces, direct where the boats go, advertise stuff on boats
because boats are cool, so the fleet becomes kind of commons. 
A goal of this project is to build a lot of mobile hackspaces where people can hangout 
and experiment with decentralised governance.

Ponzi.Bar
Is an unmanned bar with vending machines accepting crypto-tokens. 
People aquire a Ponzi token for ether, ether is spent to pay the rent, to build vending machines,
and drinks. They can use the token to access the bar, as members, spend it on drinks, 
make parties, meetups, advertise stuff and use it as a showroom (show case their IOT on cryptos projects)
The goal of the project is to provide people with a space to hangout, showcase and pilot their IOT stuff
